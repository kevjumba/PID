# PID
This is our own implementation of the PID algorithm which we will use to stabilize a ball on a horizontal beam.
The contraption used to test the code will likely use a servo motor and some sort of sensor(pot, ultrasonic sensor, or other angle sensor) and the motor will control a joint that tilts the beam this way and that until the ball reaches the desired location(middle where beam is balanced).
